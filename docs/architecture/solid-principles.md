# SOLID Principles

## Overview
This section provides an in-depth exploration of the S.O.L.I.D principles, a set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. For a Senior iOS Engineer, applying SOLID principles is essential for building robust, scalable, and easily extendable applications.
