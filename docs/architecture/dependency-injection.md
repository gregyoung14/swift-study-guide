# Dependency Injection

## Overview
This section provides a comprehensive guide to Dependency Injection (DI) in iOS development, a powerful technique for creating loosely coupled, testable, and maintainable code. We will explore the core concepts of DI, various implementation patterns, and its profound benefits for building robust and flexible applications.
