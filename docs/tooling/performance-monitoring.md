# Performance Monitoring

## Overview
This section provides a comprehensive guide to performance monitoring in iOS applications, a critical practice for senior engineers to continuously assess and improve the runtime behavior, responsiveness, and resource consumption of their apps. We will explore various monitoring tools, metrics, and strategies for proactive identification and resolution of performance bottlenecks in production environments.
