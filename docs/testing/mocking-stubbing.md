# Mocking & Stubbing

## Overview
This section provides a comprehensive guide to mocking and stubbing in iOS testing, essential techniques for isolating units of code and creating controlled test environments. For senior iOS engineers, mastering these concepts is crucial for writing effective, fast, and reliable unit and integration tests, enabling focused testing of specific logic without external dependencies.
