# Generics

## Overview
This section explores generics in Swift, a powerful feature that allows you to write flexible, reusable functions and types that can work with any type, while still providing type safety. We will cover the core concepts of generics, how to use them in functions, types, and protocols, and their practical benefits in building robust and adaptable iOS applications.
