# Memory Management (ARC, Ownership)

## Overview
This section provides a deep dive into memory management in Swift, focusing on Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) and the concepts of strong, weak, and unowned references. Understanding how Swift manages memory is crucial for building performant and stable iOS applications, preventing memory leaks, and ensuring efficient resource utilization.
